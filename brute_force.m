function [k,p] = brute_force(D)
% INPUT:  D = n by n data matrix of dominance information, uses only 
%             zeros and ones; D(i,j)=1 if i beat j
% OUTPUT: k = minimum number of changes (links added or removed) to
%             transform the input graph to a dominance graph, which can be 
%             reordered to strictly upper triangular form.
% OUTPUT: p = cardinality of set P of rankings (dominance graphs) that can
%             be created if k perturbations are allowed. NOTE: For most
%             problems P will be a partial set of rankings, not the full
%             set of rankings.
